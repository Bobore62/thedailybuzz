                Maseru- A 26- year- old man from Ha Makhoathi, Thaba-Bosiu was found dead in the neighboring village .
                A night before his death, Neo Motsepa left his house earlier for work because he did not keep the records the previous day. On his way to work, he was followed by a group 
                of boys wearing face masks. They dragged him and hit the 
                back of his head with a metal rod; leaving him unconscious.
                According to the eye-witness, the victim was 
                found lying near the road at Ha Mosalla.
                “It was around 6a.m, I was going to work when I saw a 
                person sleeping by the road side,” Paseka Lebaka said.

                He said he hooted a car so that the sleeping person could 
                wake up, but he did not. Then Lebaka stopped the car to 
                see who the person was. As he approached, he saw that it 
                was Neo. “Neo! Wake up man, why are you sleeping here?”
                “They attacked. me,” he murmured.
                ebaka shouted for help to the villagers who gathered within two minutes. One of the weeping villagers begged Lebaka to take the victim to the hospital.
                “Please take this boy to the hospital. He cannot die here 
                while we are waiting for the police to arrive,” she cried. 
                However, Lebaka told her that he cannot take Motsepa 
                to the hospital but wait for the police to handle the case.

                Unfortunately, the police were late because when 
                they arrived, he was dead. They took the deceased for postmortem and opened a case. 
                His mother said her son’s death was the hardest thing she went 
                through. She said she received the news that her son was dead. 
                “I could not belief the news. I was shocked,” she said, forcing back the tears. Sobbing throughout the interview, 
                `Mantao Motsepa said she recently buried her husband and grandchild and now it was her son; 
                who was the bread winner and hope of the family.
                “What have I done to deserve all the pain?... May 
                the evil murders of my son burn in hell,” she cried.
