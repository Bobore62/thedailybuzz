        <h3>Molotsi speaks challenges faced by Lesotho film production industry</h3>
        <h3 class="author">BY MAMELO VOOLO</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                All career industries have their own 
                challenges and difficulties especially when a person is still learning the pecks, the pro and cons of it 
                and how it actually works. But why 
                is this not talked about? Limkokwing University is the only higher institution in Lesotho that offers 
                film making programmes but that 
                does not mean the students do not 
                face any challenges when enduring 
                in the journey of film production.
                Thapelo ‘Molotsi a first-year student 
                from Limkokwing University of Creative Technology Lesotho enrolling 
                in film production living in Maseru, 
                Tsenola, talks how he as a film student encounters challenges that Basotho are not aware of. His passion 
                to study film production began when 
                he was 10 years old after watching 
                a Steve Harvey production ‘Love 
                Doesn’t Cost A Thing and since 
                from then he has been more curios and wanted to learn more about 
                the process of producing a film. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="cap"><b>ONSET:</b>  Thapelo Molotsi and crew shooting Lefa La Ntate</h3>
            <p>
                Molotsi stated that the lack of equipment 
                the school has sometimes prevent him 
                and his classmates to complete the assignments they have as the resources are limited. But he won’t let that discourage and 
                demotivate him. He has produced films 
                like Jimmy and Lefa la Ntate that have 
                been showased at Moja Love Channel 157.
                Among the reasons he chose to study 
                film is to bring change in the industry 
                as it lacks “motive”. He further stated 
                that the challenge of film makers focusing on the same film genre is a challenge. 
                “I hope to change the direction of 
                film productions as Lesotho films 
                only focus on Comedy or HIV/
                AIDS awareness films,” Molotsi said.
                Another challenge he mentioned 
                is the lack of funding and less interest within the industry. Executive persons in the film industry 
                are often interested in usual films 
                that are frequently produced rather 
                than films that are yet not executed.
                His advice to up-coming eager film 
                producers out there is that they 
                should come fully prepared for the 
                lot of work and headache the career brings and they should commit 
                themselves to be bigger and better.
                “I advise those who want to study 
                film to bring their best and must 
                not be discouraged by anything and 
                must be prepared to put in the work.”
