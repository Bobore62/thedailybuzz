        <h3 class="author">HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN LESOTHO</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                Recent studies show that Lesotho is principally a country of origin where traffickers target women and children to traffic them both internally and externally. Due 
                to the particular geography of the region, most victims end up in the bordering nation of South Africa
                According to research, the victims are made sex slaves, slaves, 
                drug mules and lately beauty pageants. Foreign nationals 
                use Lesotho as a transit point to the neighboring country, 
                Human trafficking does not only happen from Lesotho to 
                South Africa but also happen from other countries to Lesotho.
                The causes of human trafficking are high unemployment rates, migration and mostly poverty. The economic conditions that the country faces greatly influence the 
                occurrence of this type of a crime. Also, the impoverished communities, high unemployment, low levels of 
                education and pronounced gender imbalances overlap.

            <p>
                Sesotho’s economic sector is lacking to a greater extent to create jobs for its citizens for them to provide and supports themselves. Human traffickers target these kinds of people because 
                they know they are vulnerable and need an income to survive.
                The government of Lesotho has already has already came up 
                with strategies like the partnerships with international organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) 
                that will help combat human trafficking in the country but I 
                feel like those strategies are not enough. As long as the traffickers continue to do this malicious crime that means the 
                strategies are not sufficient enough. I think the government of 
                Lesotho should implement India’s law of “Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Act, 2021” where 
                culprits of human trafficking are sentenced to life in prison 
                to prevent and counter trafficking especially with women 
                and children unlike detaining them for a certain period.
