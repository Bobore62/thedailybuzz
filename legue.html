        <h3 class="author">BY  SEBABATSO ‘MOLELI</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                MASERU – Defending Vodacom Premier League champions Matlama will start 
                their title defence with a difficult away game 
                against traditional rivals Linare on Sunday.
                The champions are beginning their camping a week 
                later than their rivals because they were engaged 
                in CAF Champions League duties last weekend 
                where ‘Tse Putsoa’ fell at the hands of Cameroon’s 
                Coton Sport de Garoua. After their continental 
                disappointment, the champions return home hoping to start their league campaign on a better note.
                Although match fitness will not be a problem for 
                the champions because they have already played 
                two competitive games, head coach Molebatsi 
                Mothobi said he is not pleased with having to play 
                catch-up already.Facing Linare at the Maputsoe 
                DIFA Stadium makes Matlama’s task more difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last time the two sides met at the venue was in 
                May and Linare ran out 2-0 winners over ‘Tse Putsoa’.Like Matlama, Linare go into Sunday’s clash 
                wounded after they bottled a 2-0 lead against Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) to draw 2-2 in their season 
                opener last weekend.After the result, Linare head 
                coach Tebogo Moloi suggested ‘Tse Tala’ are still 
                not at the required level of fitness which contributed to them crumbling in the second half against 
                LDF and relinquishing a healthy halftime lead.
                This weekend’s game will also mark the anticipated Matlama debut of striker Lazola 
                Jokojokwane who joined from Bantu.Another game that jumps off the weekend’s fixtures list is the tie between Bantu and Lesotho Correctional Service (LCS) in Mohale’s 
                Hoek on Sunday.Bantu new coach Moeketsi 
                Mongoya will be searching for his first victory after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Lifofane in the side’s season opener last weekend.

            <p>
                A victory over a potential title rival such 
                as LCS could kick-start Bantu’s season but 
                there are concerns over their attacking 
                depth after they decided to go into the season with only three strikers – Tšeliso Botsane, Thabiso Mahola and Sentle Masale.
                While the Lesotho youth international Botsane is a great talent, there are question marks over
                whether he can handle the pressure of leading ‘A Matšo Matebele’ to the title. Bantu’s 
                other two options meanwhile are still unproven at the highest level although Mahola 
                did score against Lifofane last weekend.LCS, 
                on the other hand, will go into the game with 
                their tails up after they demolished CCX 3-0 
                last Saturday which has ‘Masheshena’ sitting 
                pretty at the top of the Vodacom Premier 
                League heading into the second match day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elsewhere this weekend, Lioli will also be 
                looking to build momentum by adding another three points when they take on LDF on 
                Saturday, ‘Tse Nala’ beat Swallows 1-0 in their 
                opening game and new Lioli head coach Bob 
                Mafoso said he expects an open game against 
                LDF when the sides meet at Ha Ratjomose.
