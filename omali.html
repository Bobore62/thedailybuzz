                Maseru- A local artist Rethabile Casuel Nai, plans 
                to make a name for himself across the African continent. Rethabile known as Omali Themba, aged 24, 
                was born in the South African Gauteng Province 
                in Nkaneng, but was raised in Maseru, Lesotho.
                In 2005, he went to Liraoheleng LEC Primary 
                School, Mapetla High School for secondary level in 
                2011 and went to St. Joseph’s High School in 2015. 
                “I fell in love with music back in 2012. Inspired 
                by Komanda Obbs-led crew, Lithuamajoe; I 
                loved the fact that they made the Sesotho language sound so cool. Back in those days, almost everyone wrote their music in English 
                and that’s when I formed my own group by the 
                name of Maapara Kobo in 2013”, Omali stated.

                He further explains that he went professional in 2019 when he signed under 
                Sothokids Culture Modelling Agency where he got an EP that did amazingly good in the market being METSO EA SETSO, that’s was released in 
                2019. This was a fifth track project that had powerful and personal songs like 
                MOTHO KE NTHO E JOANG?, KOLL’AMALLA and few more. He has 
                collaborated with some local artists like Morena Sway and Rumo la Koebe.
                Omali says, “The love is so overwhelming to an extend 
                that it makes me happy to see that people are loving and 
                understanding my art. It is all God, something I cannot explain in words. My single is not yet out but the 
                promotional videos that have me feeling like a star: it 
                is amazing how people cannot wait for me to drop this 
                song BOTLE BO BOKAALO featuring Morena Sway”.
                He added that with this kind of work and support, he 
                sees himself, his name and his brand all over the continent representing the Mountain Kingdom. Beside music, Omali is also a model at SothoKids Culture Agency. 
                “ I look up to Burna Boy, Slava and Morena Leraba and I would love to feature with either one of them 
                or all the African giants. So, my fans can expect the release of my new single with Morena Sway BOTLE BO 
                BOKAALO and more of good music,” he concluded.
