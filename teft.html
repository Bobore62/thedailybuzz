        <h3 class="author">BY KAMOHELO MOJAKISANE</h3>
        <h3 class="place">MASERU</h3>
        <div class="para">
            <p>25 year old and 23 year old men from Thabong in Maseru, have been accused of stealing their neighbor’s livestock: 
            five cows and five goats on the 25th March 2022, at 12 noon.
            Thabiso Kwebu allegedly stole the livestock with the help of his friend Limakatso Tlhabaki, who was supposed to be herding the animals the day 
            they disappeared. They were to sell them in South Africa so that there 
            would not be a trace of them in the country. They both appeared before 
            the village’s council on the 28th of March 2022 before being taken to Pitso 
            Ground Police Station where they were officially charged with livestock theft.
            Sizakhele Motaung*, the livestock owner, gave these two gentlemen a 
            chance of honest living regardless of their past. She said that she always 
            saw them like her own sons and never thought they would do such a thing.</p>

            <p>
                “I trusted them with my livestock because they are my neighbours 
                and they needed a job to put bread on the table,” said Motaung*.
                Kwebu and Tlhabaki were Sizakhele’s herders for two weeks before 
                they allegedly committed a crime. The community members said 
                that this is not the first offense the two have caught themselves into. 
                This time they have actually been taken action against. Chief Mahaula also stated that he does not deeply know these two to actually characterize them, 
                but he never thought history would repeat itself.
                “This is the second strike of the same case from these two gentlemen. We let the first one slide because they apologized and seemed 
                sincere but it seems like it is time they take responsibility for their 
                actions,” said Chief Mahaula. He added that hopefully Kwebu and 
                Tlhabaki will get the punishment they deserve to actually make 
                an example for the villagers that livestock theft is a serious offense.
                Police Officer Thabang Nhlapo said that the case is still pending and has no further comments about the case.
